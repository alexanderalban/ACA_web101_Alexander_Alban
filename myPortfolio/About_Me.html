             <h1> Who Is Alex Alban?</h1>
             <h3>Hello there! My name is Alex Alban, I'm the person who wrote the question above! Also this whole webpage. That's what I do, I'm training to be a full stack Web Developer- designing and coding websites and their functions. I am currently living in Austin, Texas, having performed a variety of tech/management related jobs over the course of my career. With 2020 being what is is, I chose to refocus my passion for technology into diving deep into learning what makes these wonderous things work together- programming and coding.   </h3>
